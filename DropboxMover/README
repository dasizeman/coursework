This application accesses Dropbox and tries to find a file in the root called __list.  Based on the information in
this file, it will download the desired files to the desired locations.  The file must be in the following format (without the []):

[/path/to/dropbox/file] [/path/to/local/save/location]

with new file entries on each line

NOTE: This code uses the Java SDK for the core API provided by Dropbox
