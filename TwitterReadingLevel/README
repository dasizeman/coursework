This program uses the Twitter API to analyze the reading level of a Twitter user's post content.  It works by splitting the most recent 30 tweets by the user into words and sentences, counting the words that have 3 or more syllables, and using this information in a formula to determine reading level.  It uses the following tools to do so:

twitter4j: A twitter library for Java, that accesses the Twitter API
